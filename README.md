# Sports Person Classifier

This project is a machine learning model that classifies images of sports celebrities using OpenCV and the SVM algorithm. The current version of the model is trained to recognize three sports celebrities: Serena Williams, Virat Kohli, and Lionel Messi. The model has an accuracy of 87.8%.

## Project Description

The Sports Person Classifier uses OpenCV, an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library, for image processing. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm is used for classifying the images. The project includes a frontend developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and a backend developed using Flask.


## Model

The model uses OpenCV for image processing and the SVM algorithm for classification. The Scikit-learn library is used to build the SVM model, and the Pillow library is used for image manipulation.

## Frontend

The frontend of the application is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides an interface for users to upload images and get the classification results.

## Backend

The backend of the application is developed using Flask, a lightweight web server gateway interface (WSGI) web application framework. It handles the requests from the frontend, processes the images, and returns the classification results.

## Results

The model has shown promising results with an accuracy of 87.8% in classifying the images of the three sports celebrities. The performance of the model can be further improved by increasing the size of the dataset and tuning the hyperparameters.

## Conclusion

The Sports Person Classifier is a fun and interesting project that combines the power of machine learning with the excitement of sports. It demonstrates the potential of machine learning in recognizing and classifying images. We hope that this project will inspire others to explore the fascinating field of machine learning.
